\begin{theorem}
The sum of any two even integers is even.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ be any two even integers, then there exists two integers $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$ such that
\[
n_{1}=2k_{1}~\text{ and }~n_{2}=2k_{2}.
\]
Therefore, $n_{1}+n_{2}=2\left(k_{1}+k_{2}\right)$, and it follows that the sum is even.
\end{proof}
