\begin{abstract}
Write an exposition that develops the vector space $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$, where $V$ and $W$ are vector spaces over the same field $\mathbb{F}$. Your exposition should be lively and include the following points:
\begin{itemize}
\item	Definition of $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ and convincing justification for why it is a vector space. 
\item Description of the association we have between $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ and $\mathbb{F}^{m\times n}$, when $\dim(V)=n$ and $\dim(W)=m$, and argue why this association preserves addition and scalar multiplication (here you are assuming the reader knows the definition of matrix addition and scalar multiplication).
\item	Composition of linear operators is linear, and use this result to motivate the definition of matrix multiplication (here you are defining matrix multiplication for the reader).
\item	Relate the previous point back to $\mathcal{L}(V)$, when $\dim V=n$, and specifically mention closure.
\item	Any matrix multiplication properties that you find particularly interesting. 
\end{itemize}
